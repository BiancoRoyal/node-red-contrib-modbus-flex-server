## Leanpub Live-Book

We're excited to announce our [Online Leanpub Book](https://leanpub.com/p4nr-contribution-modbus/) that covers each v5.x
version in detail. This comprehensive guide is aimed to help you learn more about our nodes and the various options inside them.
What's unique about this book is its "buy once, update forever" approach. We continuously update the content to bring
the latest v5.x changes or new options with each v5.x release version.

Moreover, we're dedicated to responding to your queries. If you have a question, not only will we answer it,
but we can also incorporate the insightful answers into the book's future editions. This ensures that all readers
stay informed and engaged. Thanks to the [P4NR B2B Community](https://p4nr.com/)

Purchasing our book will greatly support us in our mission to incrementally improve Modbus for Node-RED and beyond
with every release in the upcoming decade. Your support will undoubtedly contribute to building a robust Modbus
for Node-RED ecosystem.

## Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED install

    npm install node-red-contrib-modbus-flex-server

Run the following command for global install

    npm install -g node-red-contrib-modbus-flex-server

try these options on npm install to build, if you have problems to install

    --unsafe-perm --build-from-source
    
### modbus-serial and serialport

The [serialport][14] optional dependency is just to list all ports on your system in the client configuration.
It is not the [serialport][14] version to work with Modbus at runtime. 
For that check the [modbus-serial][2] package.json, please!
The [modbus-serial][2] supports and works for TCP connections in that package, too.
All Modbus commands running on [modbus-serial][2].

### TCP or Serial testing
If you get in trouble *with TCP* connections, then check and test with just [modbus-serial][2] first, please!

If you get in trouble *with Serial* connections, then check with just [serialport][14] first, please!

## Update/Upgrade/Downgrade

To update the dependencies or the whole package, you have just to install again.

    npm show node-red-contrib-modbus-flex-server@* version

To get a special version please set the version with @M.M.F:

    npm install node-red-contrib-modbus-flex-server@1.0.0

or global by

    npm install -g node-red-contrib-modbus-flex-server@1.0.0

## How to use

* see [YouTube Playlist][9]

## Errors

The package will catch network and other errors of the server node. 
That means, you have to handle the error status of the node and Node-RED 
should not crash in the handled cases.

## Debug

Debug will be activated by starting Node-RED with debug mode:

    DEBUG=contribModbus*,modbus-serial node-red -v

    or

    DEBUG=contribModbus:{option},contribModbus:{option},...

see [Wiki][10] pages to get more options in detail
